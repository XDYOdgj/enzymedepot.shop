But they are still thick enough for comfort and help with standing around. That being said, these things are freaking gorgeous. I thought I just had to settle for kitchen mats before that looked just okay or good enough. No, these are incredibly beautiful and will make any kitchen look new and shiny.They wipe down easily which is good with all the white spots. they slide a little but I put a gripper underneath and they don\u2019t move as much. Which is a sacrifice I am willing to make.These were 100% worth the purchase.","purchase_model":"Color: Star Tile-black Color: Star Tile-black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-06 22:39:15"},{"user":"DomCasual","content":"I picked one of these up about a year ago at our local big box store as something of an impulse purchase. We had never used one before, and the idea made sense to me. We do stand around a lot as we are preparing food or loading the dishwasher. For the price, it didn't seem like it was much of a risk.As it turned out, it was a really handy tool. Standing on a slightly padded surface really is much easier on your knees and ankles, compared to standing on hard wood or tile. The problem is that we wore that thing out. It was becoming an eyesore. But since it had become a truly useful tool, we lived with its rough look.This set was almost exactly the same price as the one we purchased from the box store. Only, that purchase was only for one mat - a mat that was exactly the same dimensions as the smaller of these two.So, for the same price, we not only got two mats, the second one was considerably larger than the first one. And, to make it better, we actually had a choice on the color. The red and beige design on this one goes with our hardwood floors much better than the plain, blah gray one it replaced.Same price for more and nicer looking? That equals five stars, in my rating system.","purchase_model":"Color: Trellis-red Color: Trellis-red  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-13 22:39:15"},{"user":"Christy Ann","content":"These are nice, fairly thick rubber mats that are easy to clean and durable. They arrived rolled up but flattened out within a few minutes without me needing to placing something on them. They did have a bit of a strong rubbery odor when I first opened them, but it went away within an hour or two. They stay in place pretty well but I might put some double sided tape on the back to make sure they don't move. They make it a bit more pleasant to be in the kitchen for extended periods without my feet killing me.","purchase_model":"Color: Star Tile-black Color: Star Tile-black  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-09 22:39:15"},{"user":"By-Buy-Bye","content":"This set of two mats is perfect for my kitchen!These mats have moderate grip and don\u2019t slide unexpectedly.These aren\u2019t the thickest or softest mats I\u2019ve ever walked on BUT for the price, I couldn\u2019t be happier.+ easy to clean+ comfortable+ great sizes (not too big and not too small)","purchase_model":"Color: Trellis-grey Color: Trellis-grey  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-20 22:39:15"},{"user":"Albo","content":"Not as cushiony as normal memory foam mats but still better than the bare tile.
